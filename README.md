### Project Overview

**Sales Dashboard**

This dashboard offers a high-level overview of sales metrics and trends. Its primary purpose is to help stakeholders analyze year-over-year sales performance, identify key trends, and pinpoint areas for improvement. The visualizations are designed to present complex data in an intuitive format, allowing users to quickly spot patterns and understand the factors driving sales.

**Customer Dashboard**

The customer dashboard is focused on providing deeper insights into customer data, trends, and behaviors. It's a key tool for marketing teams and management, helping them to understand customer segments and develop strategies to improve customer satisfaction and loyalty. By visualizing customer journeys and preferences, the dashboard enables teams to tailor their efforts and enhance the overall customer experience.

**- What's in Sales Dashboard -**

This dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of sales performance, allowing users to monitor key metrics, analyze trends, and gain insights into product and weekly performance. It is designed to empower stakeholders with the data needed for strategic decision-making.

 - Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
  At the top of the dashboard, a KPI overview presents big numbers at a glance (BANs) for the current year and the previous year. Users can instantly see a summary of total sales, profit, and quantity, enabling a quick, year-over-year comparison to         assess overall performance.

  - Sales Trends and Analysis
  A series of sparkline charts visualize monthly trends for sales, profit, and quantity, offering a quick and efficient way to track performance over time. The charts are specifically designed to highlight the highest and lowest sales months of each        year, making it easy to identify seasonal patterns and key periods of performance.

  - Product Performance
  A dedicated bar chart compares sales performance across different product subcategories. This visualization allows users to identify top-performing and underperforming categories by comparing current and previous year sales. Additionally, it shows the   relationship between sales and profit for each subcategory, providing insights into product profitability.

  - Weekly Performance and Averages
  Finally, a line chart tracks weekly sales and profit for the current year. This detailed view helps users monitor short-term performance and spot fluctuations. The chart also displays the average weekly sales and profit, with a clear visual distinction   for weeks that are above or below the average, highlighting periods of strong or weak performance to guide a more detailed analysis.

**- What's in Customer Dashboard -**

This dashboard is designed to provide marketing teams and management with a detailed look at customer behavior and engagement. It offers a clear, data-driven view of customer trends and key metrics, helping to inform strategies for improving customer satisfaction and loyalty.

  - Key Customer Metrics
  The dashboard's summary section provides key customer metrics at a glance (BANs). It displays the total number of customers, sales per customer, and total orders for both the current year and the previous year. This allows for an instant year-over-year   comparison of core customer KPIs.

  - Customer Trends
  A series of sparkline charts visualize monthly customer trends. These charts track the number of customers, sales per customer, and total orders on a month-by-month basis for both the current and previous year. This view helps users quickly identify      months with the highest and lowest customer activity, revealing important seasonal patterns and trends.

  - Customer Loyalty and Engagement
  A distribution plot is used to represent the distribution of customers based on their number of orders. This visualization is crucial for understanding customer behavior and loyalty. It reveals how many customers are "one-time buyers" versus how many     are repeat customers, providing deep insights into customer engagement and potential areas for targeted marketing.

  - Top Customers
  A detailed table highlights the top 10 customers by total profit. For each customer, the table provides key metrics such as their rank, total number of orders, current sales, current profit, and the date of their last order. This list is invaluable for   sales and marketing teams to identify and nurture the most profitable relationships.

**- Dashboard Interactivity & User Experience -**
The dashboard is designed with robust interactive features to provide a flexible and user-driven experience. Its primary goal is to allow users to explore data dynamically and tailor their analysis to specific needs.

  *Dynamic Filters and Controls*
  
  The dashboard is equipped with dynamic filters that empower users to slice and dice the data with precision. Users can filter information by product details such as Category and Subcategory, as well as by location including Region, State, and City.      This allows stakeholders to drill down into the data and analyze performance at different levels of granularity.
  In addition to the dedicated filter menus, the charts themselves are fully interactive. Clicking on any part of a chart or graph automatically filters the entire dashboard, enabling a seamless and intuitive way to explore the data.

  *Flexible Navigation and Historical Analysis*
  
  Users can easily navigate between the different dashboards to get a complete view of the data. Furthermore, the dashboard offers the flexibility to select any desired year, allowing users to conduct historical trend analysis and compare performance      across different periods. This ability to instantly switch between timeframes makes it a powerful tool for strategic planning and performance reviews.
